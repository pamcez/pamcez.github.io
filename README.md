## Hello! 
### Welcome to my Website Portfolio

* Pure CSS – Portfolio Website
http://pamcez.github.io/pamcez/portfolio/home.html This is a portfolio page I designed and developed through pure CSS and HTML.  I did not use any framework.
 
* Wordpress Website
http://www.mariafrancescatehuki.wordpress.com This is a proposal I made for Maria Francesca, a jewellery artisan in Wellington, New Zealand.   Her existing website which I developed and currently the website administrator is located at http://www.mariafrancesca.co.nz.  Her live website I developed in wordpress.org and not wordpress.com.

* Foundation Framework Website
http://pamcez.github.io/pamcez/goldway.international/index.html This is my school project I designed and developed using Foundation Framework.

* E-Commerce Website
Scooter and Pearl is an E-commerce website which I developed using PHP.  I edited all the photos, collaborated the design with the owner.  I changed the HTML and CSS of the existing template in Shopify to incorporate the design agreed upon.

### About Me

I am Cecilia. I’m a web developer living in Wellington, New Zealand. 

As early as 2002, I started editing photos using Adobe Photoshop. That same year, I took short courses in Basic HTML, CSS and volunteered for Intel-Ayala Computer Clubhouse in the Philippines.  The clubhouse is an after-shool learning facility helping kids by teaching various Computer Softwares such as Adobe Photoshop. 

I've always been passionate about learning and continously study to grow my knowledge and skillset.  

I love simple, classy and minimal designs.  My skills include Adobe Photoshop, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP and MySQL.
